# Project 3: Around The U.S.

This is the third project of the Software Engineering bootcamp at TripleTen. It was created from a Figma design brief using HTML and CSS. It uses CSS flexbox and grid to create a responsive layout so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.

The project is hosted using GitHub pages:
